This affects how a computer stores the object in memory, and how operations, such as multiplication and division, are performed.\n\nIn *statically typed* languages, like C and C++, types come up from the very beginning because \nyou usually need to specify types explicitly in your programs. Python is a *dynamically typed* language, which means types are deduced when a program is run. This is why we have been able to postpone the discussion until now.\nIt is important to have a basic understanding of types, and how types can affect how your programs behave. One can go very deep into this topic, especially for numerical computations, but we will cover the general concept from a high level, \nshow some examples, and highlight some potential pitfalls for engineering computations. \n\nThis is a dry topic - it contains important background information that you need to know for later, so hang in there. The below account highlights what can go wrong without an awareness of types and how computers process numbers."

Here are two examples: \n\n1. In 1991, a US Patriot missile failed to intercept an Iraqi Scud missile at Dhahran in Saudi Arabi, leading to \n   a loss of life. The subsequent investigation found that the Patriot missile failed to intercept the Scud   missile due to a software flaw. The software developers did not account for the effects of 'floating point \n   arithmetic'. \n   This led to a small error in computing the time, which in turn caused the Patriot to miss the incoming Scud \n   missile. \n\n   <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Patriot_System_2.jpg\" width=\"300\" />\n\n   We will reproduce the precise mistake the developers of the Patriot Missile software made.

      "source": "## Background: bits and bytes\n\nAn important part of understanding types is appreciating how computer storage works. Computer memory is made up of *bits*, and each bit can take on one of two \nvalues - 0 or 1. A bit is the smallest building block of memory.\nBits are very fine-grained, so for many computer architectures the smallest 'block' we can normally work with is a *byte*. One byte is made up of 8 bits. This why when we talk about bits, e.g. a 64-bit operating system, the number of bits will almost always be a multiple of 8 (one byte).\n\nThe 'bigger' a thing we want to store, the more bytes we need. This is important for engineering computations since the the number of bytes used to store a number determines the accuracy with which the number can be stored,\nand how big or small the number can be. The more bytes the greater the accuracy, but the price to be paid is higher memory usage. Also, it can be more expensive to perform operations like multiplication and division when using more bytes."

In a dynamically typed language, such as Python, variables still have types but the interpreter can determine types dynamically.\n\nType is important because it determines how a variable is stored, how it behaves when we perform operations on it, and how it interacts with other variables. For example, multiplication of two real numbers is different from multiplication of two complex numbers."

In C and C++ a standard integer (`int`) is usually stored using 32 bits (it is possible to declare shorter and longer integer types). \nThe largest integer that can be stored using 32 bits is $2^{31} - 1 = 2,147,483,647$.\nWe explain later where this comes from. The message for now is that for a fixed number of bits, there is a bound on the largest number that can be represented/stored.\n\n####  Integer overflow\n\nInteger overflow is when an operation creates an integer that is too big to be represented by the given integer type. For example, attempting to assign $2^{31} + 1$ to a 32-bit integer will cause an overflow and potentially unpredictable program response. This would usually be a *bug*.\n\nThe Ariane 5 rocket explosion in 1996 was caused by integer overflow. The rocket navigation software was taken from the older, slower Ariane 4 rocket. The program assigned the rocket speed to a 16-bit integer (the largest number a 16-bit integer can store is $2^{15} - 1 = 32767$), but the Ariane 5 could travel faster than the older generation of rocket and the speed value exceeded $32767$. The resulting integer overflow led to \nfailure of the rocket's navigation system and\nexplosion of the rocket; a very costly rocket and a very expensive payload were destroyed.\nWe will reproduce the error that caused this failure when we look at *type conversions*.\n\nPython avoids integer overflows by dynamically changing the number of bits used to represent an integer. You can inspect the number of bits required to store an integer in binary (not including the bit for the sign) using the function [bit_length](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.bit_length):"

To\nget the time in seconds, the missile software multiplied the counter by the float representation of $0.1$. \nThe control software used 24 bits to store floats. The round-off error due to the inexact representation of $0.1$ lead to an error of $0.32$ s after 100 hours of operation (time since boot), which due to the high velocity of the missile was enough to cause failure to intercept the incoming Scud.\n\nWe don't have 24-bit floats in Python, but we can test with 16, 32 and 64 bit floats.\nWe first compute what the system counter (an integer) would be after 100 hours:"
