They are also known as branching - the path a program follows depends on the input data. Control statements are a major part of all non-trivial computer programs.\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Introduce Boolean types\n- Introduce comparison operators\n- Learn to use control statements\n\n\n## Example of a control statement in pseudo code\n\nAn electric window opener, attached to a rain sensor and a temperature \ngauge, might be controlled by the following program:\n\n    if raining:  # If raining, close the window\n        close_window()\n    else if temperature > 26:  # If the temperature is over 26 deg, open window\n        open_window()\n    else if temperature < 19:  # If the temperature is below 19 deg, close window\n        close_window()\n    else:  # Otherwise, do nothing and leave window as it is\n        pass\n\nIt is easy to imagine the program being made more sophisticated using the time of the day and the day of the week, or being attached to a smoke alarm.\n\nWe will look at different types of control statements, but first we need to introduce boolean types and comparison operators."
