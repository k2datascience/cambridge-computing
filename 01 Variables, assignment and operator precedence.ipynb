You're much more likely to make errors.\n1. When you come back to your program after some time, you will have trouble recalling and understanding \n   what the program does.\n1. It will be difficult for others to understand your program - serious programming is almost always a team effort.\n\nLanguages have rules for what charcters can be used in variable names. As a rough guide, in Python variable names can use letters and digits, but cannot start with a digit.\n\nSometimes for readability it is useful to have variable names that are made up of two words. A convention is\nto separate the words in the variable name using an underscore '`_`'. For example, a good variable name for storing the number of days would be \n```python\nnum_days = 10\n```\nPython is a case-sensitive language, e.g. the variables '`A`' and '`a`' are different. Some languages, such as\nFortran, are case-insensitive.\n\nLanguages have reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names as they are used for other purposes.
