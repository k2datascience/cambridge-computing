In previous activities we have used built-in types like `string` and `float`, and the function `abs` for absolute value. We have made use of the standard library function `print` to display to the screen.\n\nPython has a large standard library. To organise it, most functionality is arranged into 'modules', with each module providing a range of related functions. Before you program a function, check if there is a library function that can perform the task. The Python standard library is documented at https://docs.python.org/3/library/.\nSearch engines are a good way to find library functions, e.g. entering \"Is there a Python function to compute the hyperbolic tangent of a complex number\" into a search engine will take you to the function `cmath.tanh`.

We have already used some parts\nof NumPy (http://www.numpy.org/), which is a specialised library for numerical computation. \nIt provides much the same functionality as MATLAB. \n\nThe simplest way to install a non-standard library is using the command `pip`. From the command line, the library NumPy is installed using:\n\n    pip install numpy\n    \nand from inside a Jupyter notebook use:\n\n    !pip install numpy\n\nNumPy is so commonly used it is probably already installed on computers you will be using.\nYou will see `pip` being used in some later notebooks to install special-purpose tools.\n\nWhen developing programs outside of learning exercises,\nif there is a no standard library module for a problem you are trying to solve, \nsearch online for a module before implementing your own."

This\nmight seem pedantic, but in practice there are often different algorithms for performing the same or similar  operation. They might vary in speed and accuracy. In some applications we might need an accurate (but slow)  method for computing the square root, while for other applications we might need speed with a compromise on accuracy. But, if two functions have the same name and are not distinguished by a name space, we have a *name clash*.\n\n> In a large program, two developers might choose the same name for two functions that perform similar but slightly different tasks. If these functions are in different modules, there will be no name clash since the module name provides a 'namespace'  - a prefix that provides a distinction between the two functions.
