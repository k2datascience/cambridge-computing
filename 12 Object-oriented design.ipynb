We will not delve into inheritance and polymorphism.\n\nPython supports the object-oriented programming paradigm; in fact, everything in Python is an object.\nYou have been using concepts from object-oriented computing throughout this course.\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Appreciate objects as instantiations of classes\n- Understanding of attributes and methods of classes\n- Learn to create simple classes\n- Implement and use class methods"
